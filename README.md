# 802.1X-Authentication

**What 802.1X Is?**

802.1X is an IEEE standard for port-based network access control (PNAC), providing security by authenticating users and devices before allowing access to a wired or wireless network

Why It Matters for IT Admins? 802.1X ensures no device gets network access without authentication. 

-----

**How It Works?** It involves three main components:

**Supplicant** ‚Äì A client device (like a laptop or phone) requesting access.

**Authenticator** ‚Äì A network device (like a router, switch or AP) that controls the physical access. 

<details>

By Physical access, we mean it controls whether the network port or radio channel is allowed to carry traffic. Until authentication succeeds, the authenticator keeps that port or channel in a blocked/unauthorized state‚Äîno normal data packets can pass through. Only authentication-related traffic (EAP over LAN or EAPOL) is allowed.

**Example Scenarios**

**Wired LAN: **Imagine plugging your laptop into a company‚Äôs network port. The switch port you connect to will not let you reach the LAN or Internet until your device successfully authenticates (e.g., with a username/password or certificate).

**Wi-Fi:** When you try to join a secure corporate Wi-Fi (WPA2-Enterprise), your access point acts as the gatekeeper. It won‚Äôt forward your traffic until your credentials are validated by the authentication server.

</details>

**Authentication Server** ‚Äì usually a RADIUS server, which verifies credentials/certficate (Identity) and grants or denies access.

The authenticator blocks all non-802.1X traffic until authentication succeeds. Once authenticated, the port is opened for normal traffic.

**Where It Applies?**

Wired networks ‚Üí securing switch ports so rogue devices can‚Äôt just plug in.

Wireless networks ‚Üí often used with WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3-Enterprise, where users authenticate with usernames/passwords or certificates rather than a shared Wi-Fi password.

------

Think of 802.1X as a security gate at the network port (wired or wireless). Its job is to control when and where devices must prove their identity before they‚Äôre allowed to send any traffic on the network. It does not decide how the identity check happens ‚Äî it just enforces that authentication must occur before network access is granted.

Where EAP Fits In? EAP (Extensible Authentication Protocol) is the actual method that defines how authentication happens.

Examples:
Username/password (like PEAP with MSCHAPv2).
Digital certificate (like EAP-TLS).
Smart card or token-based login.

802.1X just says: ‚ÄúAuthentication must happen here, at the network entry point.‚Äù

EAP says: ‚ÄúOkay, here‚Äôs the method we‚Äôll use to verify who you are.‚Äù


**How EAP-TLS Works (802.1X with Digital Certificates)**

**1. Device Starts Connection**

‚Ä¢ A client device (supplicant) tries to join the secure Wi-Fi (e.g., WPA2-Enterprise or WPA3-Enterprise).

‚Ä¢ The access point (authenticator) says: ‚ÄúHold on, prove who you are first.‚Äù

**2. EAP Negotiation via 802.1X**

‚Ä¢ The authenticator only allows EAPOL traffic (EAP over LAN).

‚Ä¢ The supplicant and the authentication server (RADIUS) begin an EAP session.

‚Ä¢ The authenticator just passes messages back and forth.

**3. Certificate-Based Authentication**

‚Ä¢ The client presents its digital certificate (issued by a trusted Certificate Authority that the company manages).

‚Ä¢ The RADIUS server validates:

  1) The certificate is signed by the trusted CA.
  2) The certificate is still valid (not expired or revoked).
  3) It matches an identity (user or machine) in the directory (like Active Directory).

‚Ä¢ The RADIUS server also presents its own certificate (so the client knows it‚Äôs talking to the real server, not an imposter).

‚Ä¢ This is called mutual authentication.

**4. Secure Session Established**

‚Ä¢ Once both sides trust each other, they establish a secure TLS tunnel (like HTTPS).

‚Ä¢ Keys are derived to encrypt the wireless session.

‚Ä¢ The authenticator opens the port, and the client gets access to the network.


**üåü Why EAP-TLS with Certificates is So Good**

1) Strong Security
‚Ä¢ Certificates are very hard to steal compared to passwords.
‚Ä¢ No shared Wi-Fi password floating around.
‚Ä¢ Resistant to dictionary/brute-force attacks (unlike some EAP methods).

2) Mutual Authentication
‚Ä¢ Both the client and server prove their identity.
‚Ä¢ Prevents rogue access points or fake RADIUS servers.

3) Scalability and Manageability
‚Ä¢ Each user/device gets its own certificate.If someone leaves the company, just revoke their certificate ‚Äî no impact on others.
‚Ä¢ Works seamlessly with enterprise PKI (Public Key Infrastructure).

4) Integration with Enterprise Infrastructure
‚Ä¢ Works with Active Directory, LDAP, or any identity system tied to the CA.
‚Ä¢ Supports policies (e.g., different VLANs depending on the device type or group).
